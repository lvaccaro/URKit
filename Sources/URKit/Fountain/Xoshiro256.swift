/* This is xoshiro256** 1.0, one of our all-purpose, rock-solid
   generators. It has excellent (sub-ns) speed, a state (256 bits) that is
   large enough for any parallel application, and it passes all tests we
   are aware of.

   For generating just floating-point numbers, xoshiro256+ is even faster.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
   a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
   output to fill s. */
